# Nine Man Morris 

This application is based on the real life Nine Man's Morris board game. This project has been built from the ground up by a small team of developers to fully implement all the functionalities of the game. The logic is modelled after the real rules for the game and the structure of the application and their classes adheres to software desgin patterns (memento, factory, abstract factory, etc). In addition, the team adhered strictly to multiple Object Oriented principles like SOLID to ensure a neat and robust class hierarchy. 

In addition to the base Nine Man's Morris game, the architecture included a structured system for undoing moves in the event of mistake moves, singleplayer and multiplayer experience where the user can choose to play against a partner or with a built-in player partner and the application also allows for saving of the game state to allow for users to come back to the game at a later time. All these were realised by utilising appropriate object oriented practices as well as software desgin principles. 

The game can be played by downloading the folder and running the **9MansMorris.exe**
